# WarsowBot
This is a RCON bot, enabling the possibility to server messages, remote access
etc. 

While it was intended for use with Warsow servers, it should work well with 
Quake, Quake 2 and Quake 3, since Warsow is built on Quake 3.


# Features
- Automatic Server Messages
- Remote Console

It also has some code left over i intended to use, but never got to finish.

# Compiling
No special pre-requisites should be needed. Just open the project file and compile
